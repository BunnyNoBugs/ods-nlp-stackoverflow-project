# StackOverflow Assistant

In this project, we aim to create a web plugin for online assessment of StackOverflow answer quality.

The [`models`](https://github.com/BunnyNoBugs/ods-nlp-stackoverflow-project/tree/models) branch contains code related to training machine learning models which assess the answer quality.

The technical report covering models training can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/vyjpjgdrbysv#5e7e60).
