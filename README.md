## Models training

In this branch, we store the code related to training of machine learning models.

In `data_analysis.ipynb`, we analyse the dataset and create train/test splits.
In `tfidf_baseline.ipynb`, we train the TF-IDF and logistic regression baseline.
In `transformers_baseline.ipynb`, we train the Transformer-based models.
